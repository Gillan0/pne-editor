Quick reminder
Ca = Number of Incomming dependencies
Ce = Number of Output dependencies
I = Ce / (Ce + Ca) => Capacity of a class to change (range from 0 to 1)
A = Ratio of abstract classes over all classes
D = Balance between stability and abstractness

model : 
I=0 ; A=0.12 ; D=-0.875 ; Ca=4 ; Ce=0
PetriNet.getDescriptionDetails -> ELOC : 63 Yellow Warning (green limit : 60)
PetriNet -> ELOC : 310 Yellow Warning (green limit : 300)
D => package is extremely stable and concrete, the situation is undesirable because the package is very stiff and canâ€™t be extended; (cf. former source)

adapters : 
I=1 ; A=0.2 ; D=0.2 ; Ca=0 ; Ce=22
No violations according to STAN
